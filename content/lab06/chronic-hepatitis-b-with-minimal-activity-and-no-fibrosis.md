<p>(Grade 1, Stage 0), Needle liver biopsy specimen.<br>
A 40 year old Italian man underwent a needle liver biopsy to assess the grade of activity and stage of disease of his known chronic hepatitis B infection. There was no known history of intravenous drug use, but sexual acquisition of<span class="caps">HBV</span>infection was suspected. His serum liver tests showed mild aminotransferase elevations of<span class="caps">AST</span>(aspartate aminotransferase) = 67 U/L (normal &lt; 40) and<span class="caps">ALT</span>(alanine aminotransferase) = 79 U/L (normal &lt; 40). All other liver tests were normal.<br clear="all"></p>

<h2>Questions</h2>


<ol>
<li>In this needle biopsy core, is the architecture<span class="caps">PRESERVED</span>--DISTURBED--or<span class="caps">DISTORTED</span>(i.e., cirrhotic or with extensive bridging fibrosis)?</li>
<li> Is there a diagnostic lesion present which indicates that the patient has chronic hepatitis B?</li>
<li> What possible future sequelae might be seen in other liver biopsies from this patient?</li>
<li> What is the purpose of obtaining a liver biopsy from this man?</li>
</ol>
