<p>Needle biopsy.<br>
This 23 year old man came in to the clinic with very vague symptoms, no referable history and mild fever. His serum liver tests showed total bilirubin of 6.5 mg/dl (normal &lt; 1.0) and mild elevations of aminotransferases and alkaline phosphatase. Initial ultrasound of the bile ducts, liver and abdomen did not provide a definitive diagnosis, so a liver biopsy was performed to evaluate "FUO--fever of unknown origin").<br clear="all"></p>

<h2>Questions</h2>


<ol>
<li> Which lobular regions of the liver are primarily involved in this case?</li>
<li> Does this localization of the histologic findings help you diagnose the type of liver disease present?</li>
<li> What has apparently developed superimposed on the underlying liver disease?</li>
<li> What is the appropriate therapy of this condition?</li>
<li> What is the most common cause of this type of liver biopsy pathology in the<span class="caps">U.S.</span>and Europe?</li>
</ol>
