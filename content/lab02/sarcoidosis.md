<h3>Slide #14</h3>

<p>This postmortem lung section came from a 28-year-old woman with a 3-year history of severe pulmonary sarcoidosis. She had developed diffuse reticulonodular densities in both lungs over a period of one and a half years. This was accompanied by increasing dyspnea and diminished exercise tolerance, despite steroid therapy. At her terminal admission she was hypoxic and hypercapneic despite intubation, and she suffered a cardiopulmonary arrest.<br clear="all"></p>
