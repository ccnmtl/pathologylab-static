<h3>Slide #3471</h3>

<p><span class="caps">C.C.</span>: Elevated serum liver tests 7 days after liver transplantion.<br>
<span class="caps">H.P.I.</span>: 50-year-old man with a history of chronic hepatitis C underwent a living-related donor liver transplantation. On post-op day #4 his<span class="caps">LFT'</span>s were returning toward normal: T. Protein-5.3 (nl=6.7-8.6 g/dl), alb=3.2 (nl=4.1-5.3 g/dl), t.bili=5.4 (nl=0.3-1.30 mg/dl), d. bili=2.3 (nl=0.04-0.38 mg/dl),<span class="caps">AST</span>=70 (nl=12-38 U/L),<span class="caps">ALT</span>=202 (nl=7-41 U/L), Alk. phos.=55 (nl=33-96 U/L).<br>
On<span class="caps">POD</span>#7 his<span class="caps">LFT'</span>s were found to be worsening and his immunosuppressants were adjusted in response to acute rejection, diagnosed on liver biopsy.<br>
On<span class="caps">POD</span>#11 his<span class="caps">LFT'</span>s showed T. Protein=4.2, alb=3.1, t. bili=37.7, d.bili=17.0,<span class="caps">AST</span>=572,<span class="caps">ALT</span>=1750, alk.phos.=311. Ammonia was 49 (nl=11-35 ÂµM/L). Coags remained within normal limits. Diagnostic<span class="caps">USG</span>of the abdomen was performed but could not demonstrate the hepatic artery, despite repeated attempts. Hepatic artery thrombosis with liver infarct was presumed and the patient subsequently underwent a repeat, cadaveric liver transplantation.</p>

<h2>Questions</h2>


<ol>
<li>There are striking regional differences in the staining and other changes in this slide of liver. Describe them.</li>
<li>In the large area where hepatocytes are no longer visible, what pathologic process has occurred?</li>
<li>In light of the clinical history, particularly the evidence of hepatic artery thrombosis, describe the sequence of events that led to the pathologic changes in the liver</li>
<li>In the region of preserved liver parenchyma, what pathologic changes have occurred and what region(s) of the liver is (are) involved (i.e., centrilobular, midzonal, periportal)?</li>
<li>Which basic type of cell injury is demonstrated in this case?</li>
</ol>
