<h2>Overview</h2>
During these microscopic laboratory sessions, we will cover the following topics:
cardiovascular pathology, pulmonary pathology, gastrointestinal pathology, liver pathology, renal pathology, and hematopathology.

In the laboratory, glass slides that are representative of major diseases will be examined microscopically. Your instructors will offer a "preview" of the salient features of the slides at the beginning of the lab. A brief description of the clinical case and the pertinent microscopic features are listed in lab section. By the end of the laboratory, be sure you have seen the features shown in the checklist and answered the questions provided.
