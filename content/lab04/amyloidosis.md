<p>The myocardium in this section is widely infiltrated by an amorphous, pink extracellular material (amyloid). Broad fields and aggregates of amyloid separate myocytes, in some instances extremely widely. In contrast to fibrous tissue (scar) note that there are no cell nuclei within the amorphous protein aggregates, and the amyloid is not well resolved microscopically into fibrils or filaments (this would be seen on transmission electron microscopy).<br clear="all"></p>
