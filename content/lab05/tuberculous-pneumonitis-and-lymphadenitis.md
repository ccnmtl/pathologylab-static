<p>A 26-year-old Parisian seamstress had been coughing up blood for a number of months and developed fluctuating fevers, shortness of breath and episodes of fainting. She refused medical help and was treated by a poet with patent medicines. Her symptoms increased and she died suddenly in the apartment of a friend.</p>
