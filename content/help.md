<h2>Viewing Web Slides</h2>
<p>The Adobe&reg; Flash&reg; Player is required to use the Spectrum WebViewer. For more information on installing and enabling Flash in your browser, please refer to the <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player.html">Adobe Flash Player Help page</a>.</p>

<p>In this online lab manual the "Open with WebViewer" link above a thumbnail image will take you to Spectrum WebViewer. If you are using a <span class="caps">PC, </span>you have the option of also viewing the images with ImageScope. Clicking the "open in imagescope" link on the top right of Spectrum WebViewer will open the image in ImageScope.</p>

<p>You can download the free ImageScope viewer from this Website: <a href="http://www.aperio.com/software/ImageScope.exe" target="_blank">http://www.aperio.com/software/ImageScopeInstaller.exe</a>. This software is also available on the public computers in the <span class="caps">CUMC</span> Library and in <span class="caps">PH17.</span> For help with ImageScope, download the <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/itc/hs/medical/sbpm_histology/docs/imagescope_guide.pdf" target="_blank">ImageScope Quick Reference guide</a>. <b>ImageScope does <span class="caps">NOT </span>work with Macs.</b></p>

<h2>Remote Access</h2>

<p>If you are trying to access the web slides from an off-campus location, you will need to install and run the <a href="http://www.cubhis.org/getting_started/vpn.html" target="_blank">Virtual Private Network</a> (<a href="http://www.cubhis.org/getting_started/vpn.html" target="_blank"><span class="caps">VPN</span></a>). <span class="caps">VPN </span>is a program that encrypts data before it is sent across a network.</p>
